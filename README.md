# portfolio-page

## Description:

- Develop a interactive web application from scratch.

- The web application harbors accomplished portfolio projects, with the adaptability to showcase future skills and talents as time progresses in the professional world.

- The web application runs several applications in the browser with dynamic updates. Applications include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Font Awesome, and GSAP.

---

## User Story:

- AS AN employer,
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

<u>GIVEN</u> I need to sample a potential employee's previous work...

- <i>WHEN</i> I load their portfolio,
  <br><b>THEN</b> I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

- <i>WHEN</i> I click one of the links in the navigation,
  <br><b>THEN</b> the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

- <i>WHEN</i> I click on the link to the section about their work,
  <br><b>THEN</b> the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

- <i>WHEN</i> I am presented with the developer's first application,
  <br><b>THEN</b> that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

- <i>WHEN</i> I click on the images of the applications,
  <br><b>THEN</b> I am taken to that deployed application.

- <i>WHEN</i> I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
  <br><b>THEN</b> I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
